This repository contains JUCE modules with utilities for building Chowdhury DSP plugins.

There are a handful of simple examples in the [`examples/`](https://github.com/Chowdhury-DSP/chowdsp_utils/tree/master/examples) directory.

For complete documentation, see the [API docs](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jatin/chowdsp/chowdsp_utils).

## Usage

If you are using JUCE with CMake, simply add this repository as a subdirectory after adding JUCE to your CMake project.

```cmake
add_subdirectory(JUCE)
add_subdirectory(chowdsp_utils)

target_link_libraries(MyTarget PUBLIC
    juce::juce_audio_utils
    juce::juce_dsp
    # other JUCE modules...
    chowdsp::chowdsp_dsp_utils
    chowdsp::chowdsp_gui
    chowdsp::chowdsp_plugin_base
    # Other modules and libraries...
)
```

Alternatively, you may add these modules from the repository directory using the Projucer.

If you are using a non-JUCE CMake project, it is possible to create your own static library
from the DSP modules in this repository:
```cmake
add_subdirectory(chowdsp_utils)

# create static library based on these modules
setup_chowdsp_lib(chowdsp_lib               # Name of the static library
    MODULES chowdsp_math chowdsp_dsp_utils  # DSP modules that should be included in the library...
)

# link the static library to your project
target_link_libraries(MyCoolProject PRIVATE chowdsp_lib)
```

## Examples

 If you would like to build the example plugins included in this repository, you may clone
the repository, and use the following CMake commands:

```bash
cmake -Bbuild -DCHOWDSP_ENABLE_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build --target $EXAMPLE_TARGET
```

where `$EXAMPLE_TARGET` is the name of the target you'd like to build,
for example `SimpleEQ_Standalone`.
